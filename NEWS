Release of version 1.5

The following functions are added:

- mplib_dft_u1(z, L, LB) for the self-energy `external' potential. To be
used in the DFT calculations.

- mplib_dft_u2 (z1, z2, L, LB, b) for the `effective' electrostatic
interaction potential, integrated over the lateral directions. This is to
be used in the DFT calculations.

Two options are provided for configure script:

--disable-assertions: to disable all MPLIB assertion. Use it after the
programs is tested and runs OK.

--enable-optimize: switch onmore optimization. This uses -O3 (instead of
the standard O3 optimization level) and removed -g flag. Not recomened
to use on testing stage.

Release of version version 1.0

The following functions are provided:

- mplib_potential_unary(z, L) for the self-energy, and the fortran
wrapper mplib_potential_unary_ (*z, *L);

- mplib_potential_binary (z1, z2, R, L) for the ion-ion interaction
potential, and the wrapper mplib_potential_binary_ (*z1, *z2, *R, *L).
