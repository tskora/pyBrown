This is the MPLIB library. It provides the functions to calculate the
binary and unary potentials arising from the Image Forces in Metalic
nano-Pores, hence the name.

Configure options:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--disable-assertions: to disable all MPLIB assertion. Use it after the
programs is tested and runs OK.

--enable-optimize: switch onmore optimization. This uses -O3 (instead of
the standard O3 optimization level) and removed -g flag. Not recomened
to use on testing stage.

The following functions are provided:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Raw interaction potentials to be used in MC simulations (and are
actually used by towheemp):

U1 = mplib_potentials_unary(z, L)
U2 = mplib_potential_binary (z1, z2, L)

2. Average potentials to be used in the DFT-like treatments:

u1 = mplib_dft_u1 (z, L, LB): this is essentially U1 up to a constant
but kept separatelly for clearness. u1 = - LB U1. LB is the Bjerrum
length.

u2 = mplib_dft_u2 (z1, z2, L,. LB, b): this is effective potential
integrated in the two lateral directions. here b is the 'cut-out'
radius. One can set it to be: b=0 (no short range correlations), b=d
(ion diameter) or b = (4 pi rho/3)^{-1/3} for the cut-out sphere
approximation.
